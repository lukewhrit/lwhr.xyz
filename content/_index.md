title: Hi, I'm Luke
---

I’m a self-taught software engineer and incoming freshman at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/) with a passion for building clean, efficient tools that make the internet less frustrating and more accessible. I’m the lead developer of Spacebin, Redeyes, and a handful of other projects, and I regularly contribute to open-source software like Eve.

I started programming at age 12, and since then I’ve built a variety of websites, chatbots, and utilities that aim to replace overcomplicated software with simpler, more focused alternatives. My projects now serve over 10,000 monthly users and solve real problems across different domains.

You can check out my [resume](https://drive.proton.me/urls/286ATQDA6G#6BCIs3cV8MJf) and [GitHub](https://github.com/lukewhrit) to learn more about what I’ve been working on.
