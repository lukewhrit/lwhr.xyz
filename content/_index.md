title: Hi, I'm Luke
---

Hey, I'm Luke. I'm a self taught software engineer and high school senior. I'm the lead developer of [Spacebin](spaceb.in), [Redeyes](rdy.es), and a handful of projects, along with being a recurring contributor to many more. My full resume and portfolio are on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-whritenour-b1a6b7312/) and [Github](https://github.com/lukewhrit).

I began programming at age 12. Since then, I've developed a lot of different websites, chatbots, and other projects. Recently, I've begun to focus on creating software with the intent to replace the overcomplicated software and make the internet less frustrating. My projects see 10,000+ monthly users and solve problems in many fields.
