title: Hi, I'm Luke
---

I’m a self-taught software engineer and freshman at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/) with a passion for building clean, efficient tools that make the internet less frustrating and more accessible. I am the lead developer of Spacebin and GoatRide, and also actively contribute to many open-source projects.

I began programming at age twelve and have since developed a range of websites, chatbots, and developer tools focused on replacing unnecessarily complex software with simpler, purpose-driven alternatives. Today, my projects collectively support more than 10,000 monthly users and address practical problems across multiple domains.
