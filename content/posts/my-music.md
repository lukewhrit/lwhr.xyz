Music is one of my oldest and most serious interests. There is a lot I could talk about with music but I don't plan on posting the majority of it here. You might find some articles about ideas like "Albums everyone should listen to" or "The importance of folk music to American culture," but no album or song reviews ([with exception](/posts/cantaloop/)).

If you are looking for my thoughts on specific albums, you can find me on:

[Musicboard](https://musicboard.app/lwhrit)

If you want to know what I am listening to and statistics, try:

[Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/Luke324_)

If you have something you think I should listen to, email me:

<lukewhrit@proton.me>

Although, I would appreciate if you first checked my [Listen later on Musicboad](https://musicboard.app/lwhrit/wantlist). This a list of albums I already plan on listening to. Feel free to still email me though; tell me what you like so much about an album and why I should listen to it.
